# Upply Frontend Evaluation

## Guidelines

- clone this repo (do **not** fork it)
- solve the levels in ascending order
- commit your code at the end of each level
- provide instructions to run your code


You can have a look at the higher levels, but please do the **simplest thing** that could work for the level you're currently solving.

Each level uses the previous one, you can re-use your old code.

Don't hesitate to write shameless code at first, and then refactor it in the next levels.

For higher levels we are interested in seeing code that is:
- maintainable
- clean
- robust
